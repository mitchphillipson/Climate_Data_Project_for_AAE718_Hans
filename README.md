# Wisconsin Snowfall and Extreme Temperature Analysis

## Project Description

This project analyzes the relationship between snowfall and extreme temperatures across four regions in Wisconsin, using weather data from January 2015 to June 2025. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in extreme weather events over time and exploring how snow depth correlates with temperature departures.

The four weather stations included in the study are:

- Chippewa Valley Regional Airport
- La Crosse Regional Airport
- Madison Dane County Regional Airport
- Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport

The project consists of time series visualizations, scatter plots, and trend analysis to provide a comprehensive view of changing weather patterns in Wisconsin.
